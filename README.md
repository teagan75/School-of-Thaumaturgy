# School-of-Thaumaturgy
This modpack was designed for those who have little to no experience with Thaumcraft and is a fairly comprehensive walkthrough of Thaumcraft 4 plus a few of the more popular addons. A questbook is included to take you from basic Thaumcraft to Eldritch to Ichorium. I try to make the concepts of Thaumcraft as simple and straightforward as possible.
 
You arrive at a school ready to begin your four year study in wizardry. Classrooms are designed to help you understand how to set up the large magical constructs needed. 
 
I do not make players create everything in the mods because there is so much in Thaumcraft 4 alone. What I do is touch on the important parts of Thaumcraft and have you make and experiment with some of the fun items yet give warnings against using more destructive items. This modpack is designed to make beginners feel confident without watching several tutorials online. 
 
If you want to play this on a server, there is plenty of room left in the school for players to spread out and make their own bases.

Known Issues:

 - When you receive a warp effect, the "Skyrim-like" notifications from Better Questing will black out your screen. This is temporary and does not stop you from looking in your inventory or books. A simple restart will solve this until it happens again. The dev of Better Questing is already aware.
